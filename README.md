# Audio-Locater-
The python code locates pinger using data recieved from 4microphones. It uses GCC PHAT, the second version uses GCC-PHAT with sub-sampling with using parabolic interpolation and also uses pairwise time delays for better accuracy.The direction is obtained from a method I devised taking inspiration from trilateration technique used in GPS satellites.
